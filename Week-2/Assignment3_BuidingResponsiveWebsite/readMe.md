### My Journey

#### Creating Wireframes
I started the process by creating my two wireframes:

*Wireframe #1*

![Wireframe #1](images/wireframe2.png)


*Wireframe #2*

![Wireframe #1](images/wireframe3.png)

*Wireframe #3*

![Wireframe #1](images/wireframe4.png)

I was not quite sure what to include, so designed the most basic wireframe with the elements that I know I will need on my webpage. I liked the first wireframe better, so I used it to start my HTML coding.
