        <h4>Artist Statment</h4>
        <p class="description">
            Our project’s theme revolved around the idea of impermanence of plastic and taking advantage of that particular property
            of plastic to create a product that’s timeless and relevant throughout generations. We achieved this by creating a photo
            frame with an image that could also be removed to act as an arm wear. The entire project was made 100% from recycled
            plastic waste and was designed with representing cultural identity as a priority as we thought that this would make the
            sproject more appropriate to act as a memoir that can be passed from one generation to another.
