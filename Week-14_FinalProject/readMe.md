# Final Project

### Concept
My project will be a multiplayer-capable 2D online game where players journey through a dangerous forest to conquer various enemies. Players can tackle these challenges alone or with another player. Their journey will be guided by the gameâ€™s storyline and quests. I am still deciding whether I should need a scoring system to motivate players to play this game. 
 
I hope to use p5.play to create animations and make the forest come to live. My aim is to create a very pleasing environment for players to explore.
