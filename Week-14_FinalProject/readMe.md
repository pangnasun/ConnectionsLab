# Final Project

### Concept
My project will be a multiplayer-capable 2D online game where players journey through a dangerous forest to conquer various enemies. Players can tackle these challenges alone or with another player. Their journey will be guided by the gameâ€™s storyline and quests. I am still deciding whether I should need a scoring system to motivate players to play this game. 
 
I hope to use p5.play to create animations and make the forest come to live. My aim is to create a very pleasing environment for players to explore.

### Process
#### Wireframes
My process began with creating wireframes for my website. Overall, the font sizes and the number of buttons make the pages simple and easy to navigate around. 

The first wireframe determines the layout of the main page, which includes the title, and the *Leaderboard* and *Start Game* buttons. I envisioned players would come to this page and were able to clearly see the title and click on the *Start Game* button to start playing the game.

The second wireframe is for the *Leaderboard* page. This page still has the game title at the top to help users remember what game they are playing. Below the game title is the *Leaderboard* heading and a table that contains the ranks, names, and scores of top 10 players.
