# Final Project

### Concept
My project will be a multiplayer-capable 2D online game where players journey through a dangerous forest to conquer various enemies. Players can tackle these challenges alone or with another player. Their journey will be guided by the gameâ€™s storyline and quests. I am still deciding whether I should need a scoring system to motivate players to play this game. 
 
I hope to use p5.play to create animations and make the forest come to live. My aim is to create a very pleasing environment for players to explore.

### Process
#### Wireframes
My process began with creating wireframes for my website. 

The first wireframe determines the layout of the main page, which includes the title, and the *Leaderboard* and *Start Game* buttons. I envisioned players would come to this page and were able to clearly see the title and click on the *Start Game* button to start playing the game.

The second wireframe is for the *Leaderboard* page. This page still has the game title at the top to help users remember what game they are playing. Below the game title is the *Leaderboard* heading and a table that contains the ranks, names, and scores of top 10 players.
