# Assignment 2: Building a Webpage

### My Journey
#### Creating Wireframes
I started the process by creating my two wireframes:

*Wireframe #1*

![Wireframe #1](wireframes/Wireframe1.png)


*Wireframe #2*

![Wireframe #1](wireframes/Wireframe2.png)

I was not quite sure what to include, so designed the most basic wireframe with the elements that I know I will need on my webpage. I liked the first wireframe better, so I used it to start my HTML coding. 

#### HTML Coding
Following the in-clas example, I creaded an HTML file and changed the page title to "Pangna Sun's Projects. Then I added headers, images, and description about my project.
